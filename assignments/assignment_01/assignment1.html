			Kate Wagner's "404 Page Not Found" largely reads as a love letter to what the author calls the "pre-social media internet" 
			which has been slowly dying or is already dead depending on how you view the subject, due to the internet's inherit "self-eating" nature. 
			While I understand Kate's distaste for the modern capitalistic driven internet that we engage with today, it's hard to sympathize with something 
			I have no real personal connections with. I never knew the internet intimately when it was in its "doctcom mania" or "post-dot-com crash" periods, 
			so this nostalgia and emotional appeal that she is creating throughout the essay towards these times of the internet, not reach me. With that being said, 
			I found "The Hell of Beautiful Interfaces" sub-section to be quite interesting.

			Arguably the most powerful point in the essay, was comparing the death of a website to the destruction of a library. 
			Kate discusses in the "The Hell of Beautiful Interfaces" section the volatility of digital media, illustrating how particularly sites that "invite mass participation" 
			get the chop or dumps a huge portion of its data, "it's as if a smallish Library of Alexandria has been burned to the ground." While I can't sympathize with large portions 
			of what Kate has to say in her essay this is a point that I never really thought too much about but really agree with. Websites are mini libraries, there is no better way 
			to categorize them, they are libraries of facts, learning, people, discourse. They can show a window to the past or to the future, and for it to be so normal to purge this 
			data is mind boggling. If, as Kate put it, a library was burned down there would be a great public outcry over all the knowledge and resources that were destroyed, but this 
			is not the case with websites. I'm sure this is mostly because people don't see the two the same way but maybe they should. As Kate put it, the ensuing discussion only asks, 
			"why the company folded...", and ignores "the scope and species of the lost material, or what it might have meant to the scant few who are left to salvage the digital wreck." 
			The reasoning for this is quite simple too, "the artifacts of internet life are personal—that is, not professionally or historically notable—and therefore worthless" (Wagner). This is 
			a sad but true nature of the nature of most digital content, which should not be the case. While lots of it may be personal, I feel that should be the note of it, to have so 
			much personal knowledge and experience living all in one place is a dream for people such as anthropologists or sociologists that study people and the history of people. 
			These windows show such a vivid image of who a person was or what a community was like. It is quite a shame that all that can be destroyed through a single keystroke. A very 
			notable example of this lost culture is MySpace's sudden purge in 2013. I quickly want to note that it is quite humorous that the same reason that MySpace fell out of culture 
			is happening to Facebook now, even though it unfortunately won't lead to its demise like MySpace. 
		</p>

			While I will never have the same love for the interfaces of old as Kate does, I sympathize with her call and longing for a return to form for the internet. 
			To regain some of the agency that we have lost through the "beautiful interfaces" that we have now. There is a great loss of culture, now that the internet 
			is dominated by corporate interpretations of what the internet should be.
